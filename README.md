Code, data, and instructions related to my paper on "Mapping Religious Practice in the Eminent Monks."

I am currently in the process of finalizing the instructions for running this code (and thus reproducing the work outlined in this article). Said instructions will be uploaded shortly.

If you require additional information immediately, do not hesitate to contact me at: christopher {dot} jensen {at} carleton {dot} ca.
